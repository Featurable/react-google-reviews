## Usage

### Using the Featurable API (recommended)

Prerequisites:
1. Create a free Featurable account at [https://featurable.com](https://featurable.com)
2. Create a new Featurable widget
3. Click Embed > API and copy the widget ID

> [!NOTE]
> The Featurable API is free to use and provides additional features like caching, automatic updates, and more reviews. To prevent abuse, the Featurable API is subject to rate limits. 

![Copy Featurable Widget ID](public/images/featurable-widget-id.png)

```jsx
import { ReactGoogleReviews } from "react-google-reviews";
import "react-google-reviews/dist/index.css";

function Reviews() {
  // Create a free Featurable account at https://featurable.com
  // Then create a new Featurable widget and copy the widget ID
  const featurableWidgetId = "842ncdd8-0f40-438d-9c..."; // You can use "example" for testing

  return (
    <ReactGoogleReviews layout="carousel" featurableId={featurableWidgetId} />
  );
}
```

### Using the Google Places API (limited to 5 reviews)

Prerequisites:
1. Create a Google Cloud Platform account at [https://cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project and enable the Google Places API **(old version)**
3. Find the Google Place ID using the [Place ID Finder](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-placeid-finder)

```jsx
import { ReactGoogleReviews, dangerouslyFetchPlaceReviews } from "react-google-reviews";
import "react-google-reviews/dist/index.css";

/**
 * Example using NextJS server component
 */
async function ReviewsPage() {
  const placeId = "ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRU..."; // Google Place ID
  const apiKey = "AIzaSyD..."; // Google API Key

  // IMPORTANT: Only fetch reviews server-side to avoid exposing API key
  const reviews = await dangerouslyFetchPlaceReviews(placeId, apiKey)

  return (
    // Carousel and other layouts require wrapping ReactGoogleReviews in a client component
    <ReactGoogleReviews layout="badge" reviews={reviews} />
  );
}

export default ReviewsPage;
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Google Places API **only returns the 5 most recent reviews.** If you need more reviews or want to customize which reviews are returned, consider using the free Featurable API.

## Configuration

### Layout

There are three layout options currently available:

1. **Badge**: Display a badge with the average rating, total reviews, and link to Google Business profile

```jsx
 <ReactGoogleReviews layout="badge" featurableId={featurableWidgetId} />
```

<img src="public/images/badge-example.png" alt="Badge Layout" width="200"/>

2. **Carousel**: An interactive carousel that displays reviews

```jsx
 <ReactGoogleReviews layout="carousel" featurableId={featurableWidgetId} />
```

![Carousel Layout](public/images/carousel-example.png)

3. **Custom renderer**: Render reviews using a custom function

```jsx
<ReactGoogleReviews layout="custom" featurableId={featurableWidgetId} renderer={(reviews) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {reviews.map(({ reviewId, reviewer, comment }) => (
        <div key={reviewId}>
          <h3>{reviewer.displayName}</h3>
          <p>{comment}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}} />
```

### CSS Styling

For the carousel widget to work correctly, you must include the CSS file in your project:

```jsx
import "react-google-reviews/dist/index.css";
```

To override the default styles, you can use the CSS props to add custom styles:

```jsx
<style>
{`
.read-more {
  color: blue;
}
`}
</style>

<ReactGoogleReviews 
  layout="carousel"
  id="example"
  reviewReadMoreClassName="read-more"
  reviewReadMoreStyle={{ color: "blue" }}
/>
```

Please see the documentation for a list of CSS properties and examples of how to style the component.
